## About

I am an undergraduate student focusing on **Materials Informatics** and **ML-driven materials design**.  
My current interest is building reproducible machine learning pipelines for alloy property prediction, and exploring data-driven workflows for **low-melting-point eutectic solder** design.

## Research Interests

- Materials informatics & data-driven alloy design  
- Property prediction (melting/solid-liquid transition temperatures)  
- Feature engineering & model interpretability  
- Bayesian optimization / active learning (closed-loop screening)

## Current Project

### Machine Learning-Based Design of Low-Melting-Point Eutectic Solder Alloys

I am developing a data-driven workflow that connects **composition → melting/phase-transition temperatures**, with the goal of efficiently screening candidate compositions for **low melting point** and **near-eutectic behavior** (narrow melting range), and preparing for experimental validation.

**Workflow (in progress):**
- Literature / phase-diagram data collection and normalization  
- Feature construction (composition + physical/chemical descriptors)  
- Model benchmarking with cross-validation  
- Candidate screening under constraints (e.g., low liquidus + small ΔT)

## Skills

- Materials characterization: XRD (basic), data processing & visualization  
- Python: pandas / NumPy / scikit-learn, reproducible ML pipelines  
- Git/GitHub for version control and open-source style project management
