## About {#about}
I am an undergraduate student focusing on Materials Informatics and ML-driven materials design.
My current interest is building reproducible machine learning pipelines for alloy property prediction, and exploring data-driven workflows for low-melting-point eutectic solder design.

## Research Interests {#research}
- Materials informatics & data-driven alloy design
- Property prediction (melting/solid-liquid transition temperatures)
- Feature engineering & model interpretability
- Bayesian optimization / active learning (closed-loop screening)

## Current Project {#project}
### Machine Learning-Based Design of Low-Melting-Point Eutectic Solder Alloys
I am developing a data-driven workflow that connects composition → melting/phase-transition temperatures, with the goal of efficiently screening candidate compositions for low melting point and near-eutectic behavior (narrow melting range), and preparing for experimental validation.

**Workflow (in progress):**
- Literature / phase-diagram data collection and normalization
- Feature construction (composition + physical/chemical descriptors)
- Model benchmarking with cross-validation
- Candidate screening under constraints (e.g., low liquidus + small ΔT)

## Skills {#skills}
- Materials characterization: XRD (basic), data processing & visualization
- Python: pandas / NumPy / scikit-learn, reproducible ML pipelines
- Git/GitHub for version control and open-source style project management
